    <p> Hello, I am Jaime, a self made (after bootcamp) Software Creator,
        I was born in Mexico and have been a digital nomad for the last two years.
        Most of my experience consists of building products (and teams) from
        the ground and that is my favorite setup. That has led me to learn to do
        multiple things besides coding like design, setup servers in the cloud,
        CI/CD, prioritize team tasks and manage people </p>
